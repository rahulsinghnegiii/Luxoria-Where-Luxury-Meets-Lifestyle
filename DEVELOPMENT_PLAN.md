**Solution**:
- Create a route middleware using Next.js middleware.ts
- Use Firebase Authentication onAuthStateChanged to maintain session state
- Implement role-based access control for admin routes
- Setup proper route protection with fallback redirects

### Image Handling

**Challenge**: Managing product images efficiently.

**Solution**:
- Use Firebase Storage for image uploads in admin dashboard
- Implement image optimization using Next.js Image component
- Create a reusable image gallery component with lazy loading
- Establish image naming conventions and folder structure in Storage

### Stripe Integration

**Challenge**: Integrating Stripe securely for payment processing.

**Solution**:
- Create API routes for secure Stripe operations (keeping secret key server-side)
- Implement client-side Stripe Elements for card information
- Use Stripe's test mode for development
- Handle webhook events for order status updates

## Implementation Details

### Firebase Configuration and Setup
1. **Project Setup**
   - Create Firebase project in Firebase Console

## Accessibility Implementation

### Standards and Guidelines
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Ensure keyboard navigability throughout the site
- Maintain proper color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Provide alternative text for all images

### Implementation Steps
1. **Semantic HTML**
   - Use proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
   - Apply appropriate ARIA roles and attributes
   - Ensure form fields have proper labels

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Implement focus styles for all interactive elements
   - Ensure logical tab order
   - Create keyboard shortcuts for common actions

3. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Add aria-labels for icons and non-text elements
   - Include status updates for dynamic content (e.g., cart updates)
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)

4. **Design Considerations**
   - Ensure text is resizable without breaking layouts
   - Support both light and dark color schemes
   - Provide sufficient touch target sizes for mobile users (minimum 44x44px)

5. **Testing**
   - Regular automated testing with tools like Axe or Lighthouse
   - Manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation
   - Accessibility audit before major releases

## Security Best Practices

### Frontend Security
1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides
   - Sanitize data to prevent XSS attacks
   - Implement rate limiting for form submissions

2. **Authentication**
   - Enforce strong password requirements
   - Implement proper session management
   - Add multi-factor authentication option for admin users

3. **Authorization**
   - Implement proper role-based access control
   - Verify permissions on both client and server sides
   - Use Firebase Security Rules to restrict data access

### Backend Security
1. **Firebase Security**
   - Keep Firebase API keys as environment variables
   - Implement proper Firestore security rules
   - Use Firebase App Check to prevent abuse

2. **API Security**
   - Keep sensitive operations server-side (in API routes)
   - Implement CSRF protection for forms
   - Add rate limiting for API endpoints

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
   - Implement proper error handling without leaking info
   - Regular security audits

### Payment Security
1. **Stripe Integration**
   - Never handle card data directly (use Stripe Elements)
   - Keep Stripe secret key secure (server-side only)
   - Implement proper webhook signature verification

2. **Order Processing**
   - Validate order totals on the server before processing
   - Implement idempotency to prevent duplicate charges
   - Maintain detailed logs for all payment transactions
